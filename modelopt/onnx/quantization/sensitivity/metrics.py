"""Proxy metrics for ONNX quantization sensitivity scoring.

Each metric maps a pair ``(fp16_act, quant_act)`` of aligned activation tensors to a non-negative
scalar. Higher values mean the quantization target under test caused more distortion of the model's
output, so the caller ranks targets by increasing sensitivity to decide what to keep at higher
precision. Callers pass the raw activations exactly as ORT returned them; each metric normalizes
internally where relevant (e.g. softmax for KL) and averages across the leading batch dimension.
