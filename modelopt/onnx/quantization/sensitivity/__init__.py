"""ONNX quantization sensitivity scan.

Ranks quantization targets (op types or individual nodes) by the accuracy impact they would have if
quantized. The core primitive, :func:`score`, mutates the graph with a properly calibrated single-
target Q/DQ pass (via the standard :func:`modelopt.onnx.quantization.quantize` entry point), runs
both the FP16 reference and the quantized model through ONNXRuntime, and reports a proxy metric per
target so a downstream picker can decide which ops or nodes to keep at higher precision.
